# Denser Client

This is a client for the
[Denser server](https://github.com/Raynes/denser-server) which is a simple
server that listens for a `PUT` and sets some state, and also has a `GET`
endpoint to retrieve that state. The specific purpose of these two projects is
to provide myself with a way to retrieve the IP address of a remote machine that
I have that frequently changes public IP addresses.

See the server README for more details.
